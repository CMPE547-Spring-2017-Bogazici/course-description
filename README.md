### Workflow for Assignment and Project Submissions

Assignments will be submitted via github, using git and the free github education service. 

Make sure you have an active github account and your name is also properly displayed (such as Ahmet Mehmet (ahmtmht) and not only your account name ahmtmht)

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

Enabling `Edit`->`Automatically Sync after Committing` is recommended. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository for the posted assignment or project. This will create a fork (copy) of the original repository under your account. This fork  will be still logically linked to the original repository but all the changes that you make will be local to your account.
1. Clone the repository to your computer (`git clone https://github.com/<your account name>/<repo name> `). You can work on this copy at your local machine.
1. Modify existing files or add (`git add`) new ones to complete your solution. 
1. Make sure all of your code is committed (`git commit -am "final version" `). 
1. Push/sync up to GitHub (`git push `). You have now the final version on github and your local machine.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository. This is when you actually submit your work.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the deadline and create new pull requests â€“ just add a comment in the pull request to let us know what has been updated.
